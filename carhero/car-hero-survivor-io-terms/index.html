                  Vadym Kostariev is committed to ensuring that the app is as

                  the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its

                  The Car Hero Survivor IO app stores and processes personal
                  data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my
                  Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                  that the Car Hero Survivor IO app won’t work properly or at
                  all.
                </p>
                <p class="w-element">
                  You should be aware that there are certain things that Vadym
                  Kostariev will not take responsibility for. Certain functions
                  of the app will require the app to have an active internet
                  connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your
                  mobile network provider, but Vadym Kostariev cannot take
                  responsibility for the app not working at full functionality
                  if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of
                  your data allowance left.
                </p>
                <p class="w-element">
                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                  other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                </p>
                <p class="w-element">
                  Along the same lines, Vadym Kostariev cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Vadym
                  Kostariev cannot accept responsibility.

                <p class="w-element">
                  With respect to Vadym Kostariev’s responsibility for your use
                  of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear
                  in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Vadym Kostariev accepts no liability for any loss,
                  direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                  wholly on this functionality of the app.

                <p class="w-element">
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                  currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements
                  for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to
                  extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll
                  need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
                  app. Vadym Kostariev does not promise that it will always
                  update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with
                  the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your
                  device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
                  application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
                  providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
                  without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell
                  you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
                  licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must
                  stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
                  device.
