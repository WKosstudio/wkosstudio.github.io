              Terms &amp; Conditions<br />By downloading or using the app, these
              terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
              therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.
              You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the
              app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
              to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
              to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
              versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
              database rights and other intellectual property rights related to
              it, still belong to [Developer/Company name].<br /><br />[Developer/Company
              name] is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
              efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to
              make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
              and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
              services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
              paying for.<br /><br />The [App Name] app stores and processes
              personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
              [my/our] Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
              access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
              jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
              software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
              operating system of your device. It could make your phone
              vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
              phone’s security features and it could mean that the [App Name]
              app won’t work properly or at all.<br /><br />You should be aware
              that there are certain things that [Developer/Company name] will
              not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
              require the app to have an active internet connection. The
              connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network
              provider, but [Developer/Company name] cannot take responsibility
              for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
              access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance
              left.<br /><br />If you’re using the app outside of an area with
              Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with
              your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
              may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
              the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
              third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
              responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
              charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
              region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
              not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
              please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
              from the bill payer for using the app.<br /><br />Along the same
              lines, [Developer/Company name] cannot always take responsibility
              for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your
              device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t
              turn it on to avail the Service, [Developer/Company name] cannot
              accept responsibility.<br /><br />With respect to
              [Developer/Company name]’s responsibility for your use of the app,
              when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that
              although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at
              all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to
              us so that we can make it available to you. [Developer/Company
              name] accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
              experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of
              the app.<br /><br />At some point, we may wish to update the app.
              The app is currently available on – the requirements for
              system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
              availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
              download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
              [Developer/Company name] does not promise that it will always
              update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
              version that you have installed on your device. However, you
              promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
              to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
              terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
              termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
              termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
              terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
              delete it from your device.<br /><br />Changes to This Terms and
              Conditions<br /><br />[I/We] may update our Terms and Conditions
              from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
              periodically for any changes. [I/We] will notify you of any
              changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

              data allowance left.
            </p>
            <p class="w-element">
              If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
              remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
              provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
              mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
              connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
              In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
              charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside
              of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
              off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
              which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
              you have received permission from the bill payer for using the
              app.

              Along the same lines, Vadym Kostariev cannot always take
              responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
              sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery
              and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Vadym Kostariev
              cannot accept responsibility.

            <p class="w-element">
              With respect to Vadym Kostariev’s responsibility for your use of
              the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
              that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
              correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
              information to us so that we can make it available to you. Vadym
              Kostariev accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
              you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality
              of the app.
            </p>
            <p class="w-element">
              At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
              available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for both
              systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
              availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
              download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Vadym
              Kostariev does not promise that it will always update the app so
              that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS
              version that you have installed on your device. However, you
              promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
              to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
              terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
              termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
              termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
              terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
              delete it from your device.
